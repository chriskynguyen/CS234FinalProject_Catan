CS234 Final Project: Catan

We propose developing an RL agent for the board game Catan. The agent will learn gameplay solely from the game's rules and board layout, without any pre-existing gameplay data. Through exploration and exploitation, it will learn to develop strategies for the game, pushing boundaries beyond conventional human strategies to optimize performance.
