# **CS234 Final Project: Catan**

## Project Overview
We propose developing an self-play RL agent for the board game Catan. The agent will learn gameplay solely from the game's rules and board layout, without any pre-existing gameplay data. Through exploration and exploitation, it will learn to develop strategies for the game, pushing boundaries beyond conventional human strategies to optimize performance. We will be utilizing [Karan Vombatkere's Settlers of Catan](https://github.com/kvombatkere/Catan-AI/tree/master) game framework but with revisions for our own RL agent implementation.
